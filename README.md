## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install @icose/restmaker
```

### Usage

This library is designed to work with the FileMaker Data API (REST). To use this library, you need to have a FileMaker Server with the Data API enabled. Start by creating a new instance of `RestMaker` with the server details:

```typescript
import { RestMaker } from '@icose/restmaker'

const restMaker = new RestMaker({
  host: 'https://your-fm-server.com', // or http://your-fm-server.com
  database: 'your-database',
  username: 'your-username',
  password: 'your-password'
})
```

Take a look at the methods below to see how you can interact with the FileMaker Data API.

#### Session management

RestMaker will automatically manage the session for you, so if a session token times out it will attempt to start a new session. You can also manually manage the session by calling the `logIn` and `logOut` methods:

```typescript
// Log in
await restMaker.logIn()

// Log out
await restMaker.logOut()
```

#### Creating a record

To create a record, you need to provide the layout name and the field data. Here is a complete example with type definitions:

```typescript
const record = await restMaker.createRecord<YourRecordFields>({
  layout: 'your-layout',
  fieldData: {
    field1: 'value1',
    field2: 1234
  }
})
```

#### Editing a record

To update a record, you need to provide the layout name, the record ID, and the field data. Here is a complete example:

```typescript
type YourRecordPortalFields = {
  portal1: {
    recordId: string
    field1: string
    field2: number
  }
}

const record = await restMaker.editRecord<
  YourRecordFields,
  YourRecordPortalFields
>({
  layout: 'your-layout',
  recordId: 'your-record-id',
  fieldData: {
    field1: 'value1',
    field2: 1234
  },
  portalData: {
    portal1: [
      {
        recordId: 'portal-record-id',
        field1: 'portal-value1',
        field2: 5678
      }
    ]
  }
})
```

#### Duplicate a record

To duplicate a record, you need to provide the layout name and the record ID. Here is a complete example:

```typescript
const record = await restMaker.duplicateRecord({
  layout: 'your-layout',
  recordId: 'your-record-id'
})
```

#### Delete a record

To delete a record, you need to provide the layout name and the record ID. Here is a complete example:

```typescript
const record = await restMaker.deleteRecord({
  layout: 'your-layout',
  recordId: 'your-record-id'
})
```

#### Get a record

To get a record, you need to provide the layout name and the record ID. Here is a complete example with type definitions, including the layout response and the portals:

```typescript
const record = await restMaker.getRecord<
  YourRecordFields,
  YourRecordPortalFields
>({
  layout: 'your-layout',
  recordId: 'your-record-id',
  layoutResponse: 'your-relevant-layout',
  portals = ['portal1', 'portal2']
})
```

#### Get a range of records

To get a range of records, you need to provide the layout name and the range. Here is a complete example with type definitions, including the layout response, portals and sorting:

```typescript
const records = await restMaker.getRecordRange<YourRecordFields, YourRecordPortalFields>({
  layout: 'your-layout',
  startingIndex: 1,
  limit: 10,
  layoutResponse: 'your-relevant-layout',
  portals = [
    {
        name: 'portal1',
        limit: 10
        offset: 5
    }
  ],
  sort = [
    {
      field: 'field1',
      order: 'asc'
    }
  ]
})
```

#### Find records

To find records, you need to provide the layout name and the query. Here is a complete example with type definitions, including the layout response, portals and sorting:

```typescript
const records = await restMaker.findRecords<YourRecordFields, YourRecordPortalFields>({
  layout: 'your-layout',
  query: [
    {
        field1: 'value1'
    },
    {
        field1: 'value1'
        omit: true
    }
  ],
  layoutResponse: 'your-relevant-layout',
  portals = [
    {
        name: 'portal1',
        limit: 10
        offset: 5
    }
  ],
  sort = [
    {
      field: 'field1',
      order: 'ascend'
    }
  ]
})
```

#### Running a script in a request

You can also include the execution of a script in a lifecycle stage of a request. Here is a complete example:

```typescript
const records = await restMaker.findRecords<YourRecordFields>({
  layout: 'your-layout',
  query: [
    {
      field1: 'value1'
    }
  ],
  sort = [
    {
      field: 'field1',
      order: 'ascend'
    }
  ],
  // This will run the script after the record is created,
  script: {
    name: 'your-script',
    param: 'your-param'
  },
  // This will run the script before the record is created,
  prerequestScript: {
    name: 'your-prerequest-script',
    param: 'your-param'
  },
  // This will run the script after the record is created,
  presortScript: {
    name: 'your-presort-script',
    param: 'your-param'
  }
})
```

#### Running a script standalone

You can also run a script standalone without any request. Here is a complete example:

```typescript
const result = await restMaker.runScript({
  layout: 'your-layout',
  scriptName: 'your-script',
  scriptParameter: 'your-param'
})
```

### Profiling mode

You can enable profiling to see the time taken for each request. This is useful for debugging and performance tuning. To enable profiling, set the `enableProfiling` option to `true` when creating a new instance of `RestMaker`:

```typescript
const restMaker = new RestMaker({
  host: 'https://your-fm-server.com',
  database: 'your-database',
  username: 'your-username',
  password: 'your-password',
  profilingMode: true
})
```

### Persistent mode

You can enable persistence to keep the session token between client instances (e.g. when using the library in a serverless environment). To enable persistence, set the `enablePersistence` option to `true` when creating a new instance of `RestMaker`:

```typescript
const restMaker = new RestMaker({
  host: 'https://your-fm-server.com',
  database: 'your-database',
  username: 'your-username',
  password: 'your-password',
  persistentMode: {
    tokenEncryptionKey: 'your-encryption-key',
    existingEncryptedToken: null || 'your-existing-token'
  }
})
```

The `existingEncryptedToken` option is used to provide an existing encrypted token. This is useful when you want to keep the token between client instances, otherwise read below on how to get the token on the first run.

#### Getting the token

If you don't have a token and you want to get it, you can use the `token()` method:

```typescript
const token = await restMaker.token()
```

**Note:** The token is always encrypted by default with its embedded expiration time, so you don't need to worry about anything else.
